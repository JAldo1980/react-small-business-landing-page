<p>I wanted to build a landing page that would test my React skills</p>

<p>Here is a list of some of the technologies employed:</p>

<ul>
<li>React: The code is written using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.</li>

<li>useState Hook: The useState hook is used for managing state within a React component.</li>

<li>JavaScript: The primary programming language used in the code.</li>

<li>JSX: JSX is used for rendering elements and components in React.</li>

<li>React Components: Multiple custom React components are used, including Nav, Header, Services, LinkedInPricing, WebPricing, Why, Next, Newsletter, Footer, ServiceHead, PackageHead, NextHead, and OrderBtn.</li>

<li>Component Props: Props are used to pass data from parent components to child components.</li>

<li>Mapping Arrays: The map function is used to iterate through arrays and create lists of components.</li>

<li>React Strict Mode: <React.StrictMode> is used to highlight potential problems in my application during development.</li>

<li>CSS Classes: CSS classes are used for styling, as seen in class names like "package-grid" and "pricing-grid".
</li>

<li>State Management: The isActive state variable is managed using the useState hook.</li>

<li>Export/Import: The export and import statements are used to organise and reuse code across different files.</li>

</ul>
